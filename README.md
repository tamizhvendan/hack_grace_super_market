# HACK CHENNAI'S WELL KNOWN "GRACE SUPER MARKET - https://www.graceonline.in"
This repository enables the free online directory for accessing phone numbers which was lives in Chennai and tells that what are holes on their websites and how your data had to be handled and how they this data to third parties and selling



# TECHNICAL ASPECTS
They are using PHPs Laravel framework, MySQL database

Holes on their systems:
OTP Brute force,
Authentication gaining via OTP,
Gain authentication via Password changing,
Open link for accessing users data

I've done this with the Python language. Here I uploaded all required files and their required libraries too.

Run command on your terminal:
1. python check_mobile_threads.py -> For gathering the registered mobile numbers on Grace Super Market
2. python csv_r.py -> To brings registered numbers only in a single file
3. python extract_user_data.py -> Extracting users data including all sensitive information from Grace Super Market

# REASON TO DO THIS
This is a friendly message to all you guys and do all may think what makes him to do like that, the reason is, I've a company(Peekpurchase private limited) that needs some sellers to run, on this things I looked this super market and then I went to their market and I asked for them join to our platform but refused me and throw me out. So I decided to do some stuff on their sites and apps. Then finally I found some big holes to gain users data and their authentication. But I didn't do anything on their platform users because I want to help them, So I met them and talk about this and all of them watched how does I hacked their website and they identified how critical issue was this, and they said, "We'll call back you for this solution, But they didn't made any calls to me.". After some days went by, I replied to them, They replied "we will call back you soon".

Finally I realised that they fooled me because I raised my quote for a solution (It is just 1 Lakh. Tell me guys is it more value than your data?). That's why they didn't care about this. And they don't care about their users privacy.

You guys must know how your personal data and sensitive information are super important while entering into websites and apps like this shit websites and apps.
